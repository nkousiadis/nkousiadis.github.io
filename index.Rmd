# Intro

Hello, I am Nikos and I currently work as Data Analyst. I am data science enthusiast and love working with all data driven tasks.

My daily activities include manipulating and analyzing data to solve problems, building creative visualizations to gain insights and building machine learning models to predict business outcomes.

I am <img src="www/Rlogo.png" height="20" width="20" class="top"> fan! I enjoy using R for data science and develop data products using R Shiny to automate processes and present findings.

I hold a MSc in Business Analytics from Athens University of Economics and Business and a BSc in Mathematics from University of Athens. I have solid mathematical and programming skills and experience with a variety of relational databases and big data systems.
